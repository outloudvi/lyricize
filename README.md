* On Lyricova there's also an awesome screensaver page ([a demo on 1a23.com](https://1a23.com/lyricova/screensaver/)), which is not currently on the TODO of Lyricize (We're currently uncapable of designing one). Since it's also open-sourced, we may apply the awesome feature to Lyricize after the main features are done.
